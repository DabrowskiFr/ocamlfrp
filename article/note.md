# Subject : OCamlFRP : an implementation of FRP primitives with coiterators in OCAML

## Yampa 
## Coiterators 
## High level semantics for Yampa
## Implementation of Yampa primitives in OcamlFRP
## Correctness of the transformation 
## Coq formalization 
## FRP with effects : adding references Ã  la Wormholes 
    - only wormholes if the PLDI paper is not finished 
    - otherwise allow multiple accesses 

## Future work 

# Program proof writing OcamlFRP programs in Coq + Extraction

# TODO 
## infinite evaluation on streams, not only on lists
## add global references : 
    - register references in a global structure to reinitialize them between instants 

# Notes 
## More formal development, where do we have functors, monads, category and commutative diagrams
## find a way to represent coiterators and operators graphically 
## give more intuition about the encoding of operators, in particular why they augment the state
## prove that we implementation gives an arrow (in categorical terms )

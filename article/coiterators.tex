The type of concrete streams of type \(a\) is defined as 
\(\co\ a = \Co\ (s \rightarrow a \times s)\ s\)
where \(s\) is the type of states used to generate the actual stream
and init is the initial state.
Given a value \(Co~h~s\), \(s\) is the initial state of the concrete stream and \(h\) is 
its step function. A usual stream is obtained through the \({\tt{run}}\) function defined below
\begin{equation*}    
    {\tt{run}}\ (\Co\ h\ s) = \letin{(a,s')}{h\ a}{{\tt{run}}\ (\Co\ h\ s')}
\end{equation*}
As an example consider the stream of natural numbers defined by 
\(\Co\ (\lambda n.(n,S\ n))\ 0\) of type \(co~nat\)
We have a family of functor indexed by type of states 
    $$F_S~X = (S \rightarrow X \times S) \times S$$

Operators define functions over concrete stream 

The {\tt{arr}} primitive apply a function to all elements of a streams 
$$
\begin{array}{lcl}
    head~(arr~f~s) &=& f~(head~s)\\
    tail~(arr~f~s) &=& arr~f~(tail~Â s)
\end{array}
$$

This behavior can be obtained 
Given a concrete stream $c$, the $arr~f~c$ generates a new concrete
stream.
Arrow is a simple mapping of a function to all elements of a stream.
It is the mapping function for the functor $F$.

At each step, it uses $c$ to generate a value and a state 
and returns the vale (f a) and the new state.
